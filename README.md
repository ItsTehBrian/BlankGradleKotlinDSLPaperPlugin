# ARCHIVED
I originally created this project to be used as a template of sorts to base
other projects from. However, I've since then created a CLI app that generates a
clean project similar to this one and *also* renames all the files according to
the configuration that you give it. If that sounds interesting, check
out [projutil](https://github.com/TehBrian/projutil)!

As for this project, it will no longer be updated.

## BlankGradleKotlinDSLPaperPlugin
A blank Gradle project, using the Kotlin DSL, configured for Paper plugin
development.

## Why?
Although I usually use the Minecraft Development plugin for IntelliJ IDEA to
generate project boilerplate, the plugin has grown quite outdated. Specifically,
I have the following issues with files generated by the plugin:

- The Gradle wrapper version is significantly out of date. Two major versions
  away from latest. This version is so out of date that it is incompatible with
  Java 16, which is quite frustrating.
- There's no option to use the Kotlin DSL rather than the Groovy DSL.

Additionally, I have a `.editorconfig` and a `.checkstyle` file that I use in
every one of my projects. Ideally, an IDEA plugin would allow you to create
custom project templates, but until such a plugin comes along, this exists.

Hopefully you find it helpful!
